# Week3
## Last Week's Accomplishments
We set up a AWS PostgreSQL database and created the tables. And we are keep developing the APIs.
(check the occupancy for all room on the same floor)

## This Week's Plan
Use django and the AWS DB to store the log data for us to do analytics in the future.

## Anything Blocking?
So far so good.
