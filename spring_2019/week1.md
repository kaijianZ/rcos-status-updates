# Week1
## Last Week's Accomplishments
I went through the tutorial for Django and we discussed about the functionality of our app. 
I learned how to accept user input using Django.

## This Week's Plan
I am going to develop some APIs for our hardware and store the information into the cache/DB.

## Anything Blocking?
Before I can start developing the APIs, I still need more information about what kind of input the sensors are sending.
I am still learning how to use cache in Django.
