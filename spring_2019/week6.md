# Week5
## Last Week's Accomplishments
We developed a secret-key-based secruity system. Also we can now store the logs into the database.
The front-end page is also online. So a basic monitor system is now available.

## This Week's Plan
Keep developing the log system(fix some time zone issues and bring more analytics).

## Anything Blocking?
Public safety has some concerns about our project.
