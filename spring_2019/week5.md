# Week5
## Last Week's Accomplishments
We did some research and started developing some secruity measures for our API using https and private keys.
And we are developing and testing the log system.

## This Week's Plan
Keep developing the secure APIs and analytic system. And maybe help the hardware team or front-end team

## Anything Blocking?
So far so good.
