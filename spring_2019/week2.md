# Week2
## Last Week's Accomplishments
We developed the API services for the hardware to update the status of each room and for the clients to check the accessibility.
We use cache to speed up the services.

## This Week's Plan
We can add some analytics for future use. Or we can help the hardware team to develop algorithms to process the raw input.

## Anything Blocking?
So far so good.
